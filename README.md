# clustering-visualization
Demonstration of clustering algorithms and result interpretation, using visualization. Standard preprocessing is used (normalization and PCA). The dataset used is the Cardiotocography dataset from here (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Cardiotocography). Algorithms used include kmeans, agglomerative clustering and spectral clustering. Results are interpreted via confusion matrices and the visualized PCA clustered features.
# Required libraries
sklearn, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
